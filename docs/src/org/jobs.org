#+TITLE:     Immutant Jobs

* Introduction

  Jobs in Immutant are simply functions that execute on a recurring 
  schedule. They fire asynchronously, outside of the thread where they are 
  defined, and fire in the same runtime as the rest of the application, so 
  have access to any shared state.

  Jobs are built on top of the [[http://quartz-scheduler.org][Quartz]] library, and support scheduling via
  a cron-like specification. 

* Scheduling Jobs

  Scheduling a job is as simple as calling [[./apidoc/immutant.jobs-api.html#immutant.jobs/schedule][immutant.jobs/schedule]]:

  #+begin_src clojure
    (ns my.ns
      (:require [immutant.jobs :as jobs]))
      
    (jobs/schedule "my-job-name" "*/5 * * * * ?" 
                   #(println "I was called!")
                   :singleton false)
  #+end_src

  The =schedule= function requires three arguments, and also accepts options:

  * =name= - the name of the job. If the given name is the same as the name of 
    previously scheduled job in the application's runtime, the prior job will be 
    unscheduled and the new job will be scheduled in its place. 
  * =spec= - the cron-style specification string. See [[#jobs-cron-syntax][Cron Syntax]].
  * =f= - the zero argument function that will be invoked each time the job fires.
  * =options= - options are specified as alternating key & value literals. Valid options are:

    | Option     | Default | Description                                                                                                                              |
    |------------+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | :singleton | /true/  | Marks the job as a *singleton* in a cluster. Singleton jobs will only execute on one node. If false, the job will execute on every node. |

  Job scheduling is dynamic, and can occur anytime during your
  application's lifecycle.

  You can safely call =schedule= multiple times with the same job
  name - the named job will be rescheduled.

  In case you need it, the [[http://quartz-scheduler.org/api/1.8.5/org/quartz/JobExecutionContext.html][org.quartz.JobExecutionContext]] instance is
  bound to =immutant.jobs/*job-execution-context*= before invoking
  your job function.
 
** Cron Syntax
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: jobs-cron-syntax
   :END:

  The spec attribute should contain a crontab-like entry. This is similar to cron specifications
  used by Vixie cron, anacron and friends, but includes an additional field for specifying seconds.
  It is composed of 7 fields (6 are required):

  | Seconds | Minutes | Hours | Day of Month | Month           | Day of Week    | Year                 |
  |---------+---------+-------+--------------+-----------------+----------------+----------------------|
  |    0-59 |    0-59 |  0-23 | 1-31         | 1-12 or JAN-DEC | 1-7 or SUN-SAT | 1970-2099 (optional) |

  For several fields, you may denote subdivision by using the forward-slash (/) character. To execute a job 
  every 5 minutes, */5 in the minutes field would specify this condition.

  Spans may be indicated using the dash (-) character. To execute a job Monday through Friday, MON-FRI 
  should be used in the day-of-week field.

  Multiple values may be separated using the comma (,) character. The specification of 1,15 in the 
  day-of-month field would result in the job firing on the 1st and 15th of each month.

  Either day-of-month or day-of-week must be specified using the ? character, since specifying
  both is contradictory.

  See the [[http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-1.x/tutorials/TutorialLesson06][Quartz cron specification]] for additional details.

** Job MBeans
   
   Each job scheduled gets its own mbean under the =immutant.jobs= namespace. This mbean can be used
   to stop, start, and reschedule the job.

* Unscheduling Jobs
  
  Jobs can be unscheduled via the [[./apidoc/immutant.jobs-api.html#immutant.jobs/unschedule][immutant.jobs/unschedule]] function:

  #+begin_src clojure
    (require '[immutant.jobs :as jobs])
    
    (jobs/unschedule "my-job-name")
  #+end_src

  The =unschedule= function requires one argument:

  * =name= - the name of a previously scheduled job.

  If the given name resolves to an existing job, that job will be unscheduled and the call will
  return =true=, otherwise =nil= is returned.

  Jobs are automatically unscheduled when your application is undeployed.
